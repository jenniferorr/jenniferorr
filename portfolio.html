    <h1>  This was an image from my 1.1.9 project. For our project, Sakina and I created  game called "Feelings of the Day" We used user input to decide what image to display. Our options included happy, sad, embarrassed, and angry. We struggled to include motion therefore for the images we included GIFs.  </h1>

    <br>  This is an image from my scratch project with Anthony. For our project we made a cup shuffle game where there is a countdown. A pufferfish is hidden under one of three cups then the cups shuffle and you have a certian amount of time to click on the correct cup with the pufferfish under it.
